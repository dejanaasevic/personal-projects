# ReactFacts

This is my first React project! It’s a simple static site that displays fun facts about React using JSX and React components.  
The layout was styled with CSS, and the project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## 🛠️ Features
- Clean component-based structure

- Simple and informative layout
- Fun facts about React
